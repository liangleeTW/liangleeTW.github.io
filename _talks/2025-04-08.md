In this talk, I will explore the intersection between these two rapidly evolving fields. Artificial intelligence, particularly modern advancements like Large Language Models (LLMs) and deep learning, has drawn heavily from insights in cognitive neuroscience. Concepts such as neural networks, predictive coding, and reinforcement learning have been inspired by our understanding of brain processes — and in turn, AI has become an invaluable tool for advancing our knowledge of the mind. I will begin by providing a brief history of AI development, illustrating how neuroscience has influenced key breakthroughs in machine learning and cognitive modeling. From there, how AI systems are now being applied to enhance our understanding of cognitive neuroscience will be introduced. I'll highlight practical examples of how researchers are leveraging these technologies to decode brain activity, improve experimental design, and uncover new insights into neural mechanisms. However, while AI holds great promise, it also presents serious challenges — particularly in terms of AI safety. I will discuss potential risks, such as biased models, fabricated information (AI hallucinations), and the dangers of over-relying on AI without proper oversight. Ensuring the safe and responsible application of AI is crucial, especially when applied to sensitive areas like neuroscience research. Finally, I will emphasize the importance of developing a clear understanding of AI's capabilities and limitations so that we can harness these technologies appropriately in cognitive neuroscience research. By recognizing what AI can and cannot do, we can unlock new opportunities to deepen our understanding of the mind.
