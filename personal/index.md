# About Me

I am a PhD student at the Institute of Neuroscience, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), affiliated with the Brain Connectivity Lab and Brain Plasticity Lab. Before starting my PhD, I worked as an AI Researcher and Software Engineer, building LLM-powered educational tools and analyzing learning behavior data.

I hold a Master of Education in Cognition and Science Learning from NYCU (with a concurrent program in Big Data Analysis) and a Bachelor of Science in Electrophysics. I also hold a K-12 Science Teaching Certificate with a specialism in Physics.
