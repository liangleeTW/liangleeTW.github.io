# Research

My research lies at the intersection of **cognitive neuroscience** and **artificial intelligence**. I am interested in understanding how the brain processes information and how we can leverage AI to model and explain cognitive phenomena.

## Research Interests

- Large Language Models
- Cognitive Neuroscience
- Deep Learning
- Explainable AI
- Bayesian Inference
- Decision-Making
- State Space Models
- Causal Inference
- Reinforcement Learning
- Retrieval Augmented Generation

## Experience

### AI Researcher — Digital Transformation Project, NYCU (2024–Present)
- Finetune large language models for AI tutor applications
- Implement personalized feedback mechanisms based on learner input
- Design and integrate adaptive testing modules for tailored assessments
- Develop avatar-based teaching systems with interactive visual interfaces

### Software Engineer — Higher Education Resources for Openness, NYCU (2022–2024)
- Develop LLM-based AI tutor and assessment tools
- Analyze big data for learning behavior outcomes and decision-making
- Research learning effectiveness in MOOCs

### Research Assistant — Cognition and Science Learning, NYCU (2019–2021)
- Refined fMRI tasks and organized behavioral-neural data for analyzing brain activation during conceptual conflict
- Collected online learning logs and mental models to analyze how self-generated representations affect inquiry performance
- Analyzed eye-tracking and fMRI data to examine attention and reasoning in conceptual change
