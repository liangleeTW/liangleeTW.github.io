# Research

My research lies at the intersection of **cognitive neuroscience** and **artificial intelligence**. I am interested in understanding how the brain processes information and how we can leverage AI to model and explain cognitive phenomena.

## Research Interests

- Large Language Models
- Cognitive Neuroscience
- Deep Learning
- Explainable AI
- Bayesian Inference
- Decision-Making
- State Space Models
- Causal Inference
- Reinforcement Learning
- Retrieval Augmented Generation
